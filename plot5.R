## Get and load the data

# check the RDS data files are in the current directory

# How have emissions from motor vehicle sources changed from 1999â€“2008 in Baltimore City?

# look at the SCC data, which holds source codes
head(SCC)

# find a field holding motor vehicle combustion
names(SCC)
table(SCC$EI.Sector)

# select rows in SCC that have vehicle in the EI.Sector variable
vehiclesccs <- filter(SCC, grepl("Vehicle|vehicle", EI.Sector))

# get the SCC codes from the vehiclessccs dataframe
vehiclescccodes <- unique(vehiclesccs$SCC)

# now select rows in NEI that have a value in the SCC field that is one of the vehicle scc codes I have stored in the vector above and where Baltimore is the city
baltimore_vehicle_neis <- subset(NEI, SCC %in% vehiclescccodes & fips == "24510")

# use dplyr to calculate the total PM2.5 emissions from all vehicle-related sources for Baltimore
totalpm25 <- baltimore_vehicle_neis %>% group_by(year) %>% summarise(totalemissions = sum(Emissions))

# Answer: Motor vehicle-related emissions of PM2.5 have decreased in Baltimore between 1999 and 2008.

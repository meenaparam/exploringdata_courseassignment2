## Get and load the data

# check the RDS data files are in the current directory

# read in the two data sets

# load dplyr package for later data manipulation

# Across the United States, how have emissions from coal combustion-related sources changed from 1999â€“2008?

# look at the SCC data, which holds source codes
head(SCC)

# find a field holding coal combustion
names(SCC)
table(SCC$EI.Sector) # a bit vague but seems to hold coal details

# select rows in SCC that have coal in the EI.Sector variable
coalsccs <- filter(SCC, grepl("Coal|coal", EI.Sector))

# get the SCC codes from the coalsccs dataframe
coalscccodes <- unique(coalsccs$SCC)

# now select rows in NEI that have a value in the SCC field that is one of the coal scc codes I have stored in the vector above
coalneis <- subset(NEI, SCC %in% coalscccodes)

# use dplyr to calculate the total PM2.5 emissions from all coal-related sources for the US
totalpm25 <- coalneis %>% group_by(year) %>% summarise(totalemissions = sum(Emissions))

# set 12 point font for the title

ggplot(data = totalpm25, aes(x = year, y = totalemissions)) + geom_point() + geom_line() + labs(x = "Year", y = "Total PM2.5 emissions (tons)") + ggtitle("Total Emissions of PM2.5 from coal combusation-related sources  \n in the United States between 1999 and 2008") + theme(plot.title = element_text(size=12, face="bold.italic")) + scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(1999,2008,1)) + scale_y_continuous(limits = c(0, 600000), breaks = seq(0, 600000, 100000), labels = comma)

# close the device
dev.off()

# tidy up
rm(coalneis, coalsccs, totalpm25, coalscccodes)

# Answer: Coal combustion-related emissions of PM2.5 have decreased between 1999 and 2008.
